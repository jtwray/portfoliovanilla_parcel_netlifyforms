          <p>
            Meet me, a mid-level web applications developer with a passion for continuous learning and growth. With over
            30 months of professional experience in React UI development, I've honed my skills through hands-on practice
            and deep self-study.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a certified AWS Cloud Practitioner and Lightning JS Smart TV Applications Developer, I bring specialized
            expertise to the table. What truly sets me apart is my dedication to mentorship and leadership.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my time at Lambda School, I mentored 42 junior developers over 15 months, conducting over 1,600
            one-on-one code reviews. I've led cross-functional teams, collaborating with mobile developers, full-stack
            engineers, and data scientists to deliver cutting-edge web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the face of complex codebases, I've mastered the art of refactoring and implementing declarative
            programming principles, transforming chaos into elegance. My mission? To empower the next generation of
            software engineers and drive innovation in the ever-evolving world of web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently nourish my growth mindset and apply my love of D-I-Y at Per Scholas in the AWS re/Start Program,
            where I obtained my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification on February 23, 2024.

          <h3>What I Love Doing</h3>
          <p>
            I spend a fair amount of time working on code reviews, leading stand-ups, and truly enjoy squashing bugs in
            pair programming sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work and school, I employ the latest advancements in software to iterate on solutions for
            real-world problems. Some of my current aspirations involve building web applications to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Help source local goods such as produce and services</li>
            <li>Provide options for producing renewable energy at a small scale</li>
            <li>Offer suggestions for recycling plastic bottles at home based on geolocation</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

          <h3>Life Outside Code</h3>
          <p>
            When I'm not in a Zoom call, terminal, or Slack chat, you'll find me:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wrestling my dog or cats</li>
            <li>Turning a wrench under my Jeep</li>
            <li>Relaxing by a creek in the forest</li>
          </ul>
